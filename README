# Color Changing App

This is a simple web app that demonstrates three different ways to change the background color of a webpage using JavaScript: using callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

## Installation

To run this app locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have those, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you should see three buttons on the page labeled "Callbacks", "Promises", and "async/await". Clicking each button will trigger a different color-changing function that demonstrates that approach.

## Code Structure

The code for this app is divided into several files:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file for the app.
- `main.js` - The entry point for the JavaScript code. Imports the color-changing functions and sets up event listeners on the buttons.
- `usingCallbacks.js` - Defines the color-changing function using callbacks.
- `usingPromises.js` - Defines the color-changing function using Promises.
- `usingAsyncAwait.js` - Defines the color-changing function using async/await.
